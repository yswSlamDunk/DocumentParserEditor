아니나 기원전 1800년경에 아일랜드\n에서는‘무거운 물체를 들어올리기’,‘무거운 물\n체를 던지기’경기가 행해졌다고 전해지고 있\n다. 아마 이것이 역도의 기원이라고 하는 학\n자도 있으나, 정확한 역도의 기원을 확인하는\n것은 어렵다.\n\n그 후, 기원전 6세기 후반부터 5세기에 이르 그림 1. 기원전 5세기 그리스에서\n행해진 무거운 물체던지기1)\n기까지 수많은 역사가 출현하여 그 이름이 후\n세까지 구전되고 있다. 소위 이 시대를 체육사에서 말하는‘힘의 시대’라고 일컫는\n\n그림 2. 고대올림픽의 한 종목인 one hand twist1)\n- 1 -\n다. 이 시대에서 특히 제 60-66회까지 올림피\n아의 레슬링경기에 우승한 크로토나의 말로\n(Crotona Milo)는 송아지가 큰 소로 성장할 때\n까지 매일 이것을 어깨에 짊어지고 걷는 훈련\n을 하였다고 전해지고 있다(역도, 2006). 이와\n같이 가벼운 중량으로부터 무거운 중량으로\n근육을 서서히 단련시켜 나가는 방법이 현재\n의‘점진적 과부하’의 원리로서 역도경기의\n근본원리를 이루고 있다고 할 수 있다.\n\n그림 3. 고대 역도경기11)\n고대 그리스 이전으로부터 돌을 들어 올린\n다든지, 던진다던지 하는 소박한 역기가 존재 하였던 것을 알 수 있으며,\n우리나라의 돌 들기와 중국의 둔스, 일본의 지카라이시 등의 전설이 여러\n터 확인되어 동ㆍ서양을 불문하고 소박한 형\n태의 중량 들어올리기로서, 원시적인 힘의 자\n랑방법으로 행해졌다.\n고대의\n역도경기가 근대적인 형태를 갖추기 시작한\n것은 1800년대부터라고 할 수 있다. 구츠무츠\n(1749-1839)의 청년체조, 얀의(1778-1846)의 덤\n벨 운동이 세상에 소개된 이후, 얀의 제자인\n아이젤린(1793-1846)에 의하여‘덤벨 체조 소\n서’가 발행되면서 근대 역도가 태동했다고\n할 수1)있다.\n곳으로부\n그림 4. 고대 역도경기1)\n\n덤벨의 발달은 이와 같이 체조를 개입시켜 진보하였지만, 무거운 덤벨이나 바벨\n에 의한 역기가 성행되기 시작하여 유럽에서는 각종 역기자가 배출하여 뮤직홀이\n나 서커스의 무대를 장식하였다. 그 중에서 유젠 산도우(Eugen Sandow, 1867-1925)\n1) \"The Lost Past\", Gottfried, Gutenberg Ltd. 1992\n- 2 -"}, "elements": [{"category":
